# Mechanical Ventilation Simulator
This application simulates a setup involving a test lung and mechanical ventilator (MV). Users can apply basic parameters to the lung and MV models and observe how this impacts basic ventilation metrics.

## Who might use this application?
Learners of respiratory physiology.

## Why did I make this project?
I'm a respiratory therapist with a keen interest in respiratory physiology and mechanical ventilation.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to parameterize a lung simulator so that I can see how it behaves when ventilated.
2. As a user, I want to parameterize a mechanical ventilation simulator so I can see how the same lung simulator responds to different ventilator modes and settings.
3. As a user, I want to be able to observe the output metrics from ventilating the lung simulator so that I can reason about the mode and settings being used.
