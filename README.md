# Mechanical Ventilation Simulator

This application simulates a setup involving a test lung and mechanical ventilator (MV). Users can apply basic parameters to the lung and MV models and observe how this impacts basic ventilation metrics.

## Who might use this application?
Learners of respiratory physiology.

## Why did I make this project?
I'm a respiratory therapist with a keen interest in respiratory physiology and mechanical ventilation.
